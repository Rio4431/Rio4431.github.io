# Rio4431 Portfolio

A curated GitHub Pages portfolio for selected software projects.

The site intentionally shows only projects chosen for portfolio use rather than automatically listing every public GitHub repository.

## Project visibility management

Portfolio entries are managed in `projects.js`.

Each project has a `visible` setting:

```js
{
  title: "Molarity Calculator",
  visible: true,
  // ...
}
```

- `visible: true` — the project is shown on the portfolio.
- `visible: false` — the project remains in `projects.js` but is hidden from the portfolio.

The display order is the same as the order of entries in `projects.js`. Project numbers are generated automatically from the currently visible entries.

This makes it possible to change which projects are shown to employers without deleting repositories or editing the main HTML layout.

## Included projects

The current configuration includes:

- OpenAlex Literature Search
